caption: PPI network and hub genes analysis. A A total of 268 co-expression genes
  of eight ITGBs were uploaded onto the STRING database to get the PPI network of
  eight ITGBs. The PPI network was visualized by the Cytoscape software. The color
  and size of each gene represent the degree of the corresponding gene. The minimum
  degree is 1 and the maximum degree is 67. Colored edges represent the co-expression
  values between genes. Only edges with co-expression value > 0.5 were colored with
  continuously deepened blue. B The top 15 hub genes were identified by degree parameter
  in the Cytoscape software. C GO analysis of the top 15 hub genes. D KEGG analysis
  of the top 15 hub genes
article_title: Identification of the biological functions and chemo-therapeutic responses
  of ITGB superfamily in ovarian cancer.
