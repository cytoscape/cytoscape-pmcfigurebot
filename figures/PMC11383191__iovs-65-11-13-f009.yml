caption: 'PPI networks. (A) Integrated protein‒protein interaction network of significantly
  enriched pathways in hCMFs. (B–E) Subnetworks of the four pathways related to the
  genes exhibiting the most significant enrichment: EMT (B), mTORC1 signaling (C),
  TGFβ signaling (D), and angiogenesis (E), derived from GSEA using gene counts. Influential
  nodes, as determined by the MCC algorithm using CytoHubba in Cytoscape, are emphasized
  to indicate their central role in the network (red to yellow color scale, with red
  indicating the most influential nodes).'
