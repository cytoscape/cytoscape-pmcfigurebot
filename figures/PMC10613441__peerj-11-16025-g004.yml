figure_title: PPI networks, two significant modules of the PPI network, Upstream regulatory
  network of the co-expressed DEGs and CytoHubba find the key genes
caption: '(A) A graphic representation of the PPI networks based on co-expressed DEGs.
  (B–C) Graphic representation of two significant modules of the PPI network. (C)
  Module 1, D: Module 2. (D) Upstream regulatory network of the co-expressed DEGs.
  Blue points represent enrichment for kinase likely to regulate co-expressed DEGs.
  Red points represent enrichment for transcription factors likely to regulate co-expressed
  DEGs. Gray points represent co-expressed DEGs. (E) A graphic representation of the
  co-expressed DEGs network based on degree. The CytoHubba in Cytoscape to find the
  key genes. Circle color represents gene rank.'
