caption: 'The illustration shows subnetworks acquired from the networks of target
  genes of upregulated and downregulated miRNAs, respectively, using the MCC model
  in the Cytoscape. Potential downregulated hub genes in a protein–protein interaction
  network (PPI) (A). Possible upregulated hub genes in a network of PPI. The grade
  of node color displays the degree of connectivity: orange color presents the intermediate
  degree, yellow color indicates the lowest degree, and red color represents the highest
  degree (B).'
