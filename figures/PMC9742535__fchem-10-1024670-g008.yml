caption: RIOK2-related genes and proteins analysis in tumor tissues. (A) A connectivity
  map of the PPI network involving 76 experimentally available RIOK2 interaction proteins
  from the STRING database linked via 2,290 interactions. Major hubs are highlighted
  in red. The minimum required interaction score was for medium confidence (0.400).
  The resulting PPI network was visualized using Cytoscape and further analyzed using
  molecular complex detection. (B) A radar chart shows that the correlation between
  RIOK2 expression and five proteins was assessed by purity-adjusted partial Spearman’s
  rho-value in pan-cancer. (C) Genes that correlated with RIOK2 expression with the
  top 500 Spearman correlation coefficients were obtained from TCGA. The expression
  correlation of the top eight RIOK2-related genes and RIOK2 was visualized by scatter
  plots using Spearman’s correlation for supplementary verification.
