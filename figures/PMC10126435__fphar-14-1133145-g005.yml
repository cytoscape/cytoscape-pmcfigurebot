caption: Hub genes screening based on PPI network of immune-related genes. (A) Protein-protein
  interaction (PPI) analysis based on STRING tool. Cytoscape software was used for
  visualization. The larger the genes involved, the larger the degree of nodes, and
  the thicker the lines, the larger the number of betweenness. (B) Top ten hub genes
  (LCK, CD3E, CD4, CD3D, CD274, IL7R, ZAP70, CD2, CCL5, and CD28) screened based on
  MNC algorithm. (C) Top ten hub genes (CD4, ZAP70, CD2, FYN, CD28, GZMA, LCK, CD3E,
  IL7R, and CD3D) screened based on MCC algorithm. (D) Top ten hub genes (CD79A, CD7,
  GPR29, ZAP70, TCF7, TRAT1, FYN, MAP4K1, SKAP1, LAT) screened based on DMNC algorithm.
  (E) Intersection of hub genes screened by the above three algorithms.
