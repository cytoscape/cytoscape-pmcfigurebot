caption: 'LAMP1 protein–protein interaction network reveals its role in immune regulation.
  (A) KEGG-GSEA enrichment analysis of LAMP1 correlated genes on GSE6575 (upper) and
  GSE18123 (lower) datasets. (B) The protein–protein interacting (PPI) network of
  LAMP1 was obtained from STRING (string-db.org) and visualized using Cytoscape software
  (3.8.4). (C) The top 10 hub-gene was calculated using cytoHubba plugin in software
  using Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) algorithm. (D) PPI network connectivity for
  LAMP1 and DEGs genes identified as up-regulated in ASD groups constructed by STRING
  (https://string-db.org/). (E) The WikiPathway enrichment analysis according to PPIs
  of the STRING enrichment results. (F) Human phenotype prediction of LAMP1 using
  Harmonizome database indicating as Z-score. (G) Immune cell enrichment analysis
  of GSE6575 using TIMER2.0 and that correlation assay between LAMP1 mRNA expression
  associations with neutrophil enrichment content was performed. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes.'
