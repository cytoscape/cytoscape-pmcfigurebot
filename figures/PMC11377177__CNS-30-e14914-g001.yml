caption: Bioinformatics analysis of Alzheimer's disease candidate genes regulated
  by Gingko leaf extract and its key signaling pathways. (A) Schematic representation
  of the bioinformatics analysis workflow, illustrating the analytical steps involved
  in the potential regulation of AD key signaling pathways by Gingko leaf extract.
  (B–D) GO analysis results of AD candidate genes possibly regulated by Gingko leaf
  extract, showing the top 10 results for biological processes (BP), cellular components
  (CC), and molecular functions (MF), with adjusted p‐values. (E) KEGG pathway analysis
  results of 35 AD candidate genes potentially regulated by Gingko leaf extract, represented
  by a GOKEGG‐EMAP diagram, with the size of the dots indicating the number of selected
  genes and the color intensity representing the significance of the enrichment analysis
  (p‐value). (F) KEGG enriched pathways for gene heatmap analysis (G) protein–protein
  interaction (PPI) network diagram of the 35 AD candidate genes potentially regulated
  by Gingko leaf extract, constructed using STRING database data and visualized using
  Cytoscape software. The font size and background color of the genes in the network
  diagram represent the degree value. (H) Ranking of degree values in the protein–protein
  interaction network, highlighting the proteins that may play a crucial role in AD.
