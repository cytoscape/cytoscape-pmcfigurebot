caption: SSTRs and SSTR-associated molecules co-expressed in COAD and their predicted
  functions and signaling pathways. (A) The cBioPortal database was used to identify
  the 178 SSTR-associated co-expressed molecules that are most frequently altered
  in COAD. SSTR family members and their associated co-expressed genes were used to
  generate the PPI network using the Cytoscape database. (B–F) Functional enrichment
  analysis was used to analyze the biological functions of the SSTR family members
  and their co-expressed genes. COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; PPI, protein–protein interaction;
  SSTRs, somatostatin receptors.
article_title: Immunological role and prognostic value of somatostatin receptor family
  members in colon adenocarcinoma.
