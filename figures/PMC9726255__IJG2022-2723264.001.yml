caption: Venn diagram, PPI network, and module of IL1RN. (a) DEGs were selected with
  a fold change >1 and P < 0.01 among the mRNA expression profiling sets GSE41328,
  GSE37364, and GSE15960. (b) The PPI network of DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape.
  (c) The most module of IL1RN was obtained from PPI network with 33 edges.
