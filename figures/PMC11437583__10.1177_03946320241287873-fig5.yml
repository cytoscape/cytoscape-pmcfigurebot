caption: The PPI network constructed for ATL potential targets. The STRING network
  consisted of 92 nodes, among which CDK6 was functionally and physically interacted
  with 23 targets (a). Nodes in the PPI network in Cytoscape were interacted with
  1516 edges, among which 40 nodes were defined as hub genes (b). The color mapping
  identifies nodes from significantly high (red) to low (yellow) expression.
