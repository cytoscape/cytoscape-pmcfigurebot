figure_title: The PPI network diagram of 136 shared proteins
caption: (A), The overall PPI network diagram of 136 shared proteins. (B)-(E), The
  four core clusters identified using the Molecular Complex Detection plugin in Cytoscape,
  shown individually. (F), The PPI network of the top 15 proteins by MCC. These proteins
  are part of highly interconnected subnetworks (cliques) within the PPI network.
  (G), The PPI network of the top 15 proteins by Degree. These proteins are key hubs
  in the PPI network. As in (F and G), nodes are colored based on their Degree or
  MCC scores, with red indicating more higher scores. In all panels (A)-(G), targets
  are labeled with their name abbreviations. PPI, Protein-Protein Interaction; MCC,
  Maximal Clique Centrality.
