caption: PPI network of FAA compound targets against breast cancer. (A) The PPI network
  was constructed using Cytoscape. Different colors represent the degree, as indicated
  by the scale. The size of the circle also indicates the degree. (B) The top 30 target
  genes of FAA against breast cancer screened by the PPI network. The X-axis represents
  degree values. (C) The cluster generated from (A). The red diamond in (C), AKT1,
  was the seed in this cluster and interacted with other FAA targets. PPI, protein-protein
  interaction; FAA, folium Artemisia argyi.
