caption: Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network among depleted or enriched genes.
  (A) The hub genes of the PPI. The PPI network was generated by the STRING database
  with default settings and was built by Cytoscape. The cluster of hub genes within
  the red frame was calculated using MCODE in Cytoscape with the default setting.
  (B) The top enriched REACTOME pathways of the hub genes. The enrichment analysis
  was performed and visualized by Cytoscape using the plugin Cluego and CluePedia.
  The sector graphs indicated the portion of related genes compared with all the enriched
  pathway genes.
