caption: PPI network and the most significant modules of DEGs. (A) The PPI network
  of DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape; (B) the most significant module was obtained
  from PPI network with 16 nodes and 44 edges for upregulated genes; (C) the most
  significant module was obtained from PPI network with 6 nodes and 20 edges for upregulated
  genes. Upregulated genes are marked in green; downregulated genes are marked in
  red. DEGs indicate differentially expressed genes; PPI, protein-protein interaction
  network.
