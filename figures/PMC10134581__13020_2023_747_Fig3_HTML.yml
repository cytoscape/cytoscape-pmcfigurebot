caption: Network pharmacology prediction for GQD standard decoction treatment of CID.
  A Venn analysis showing the crosstalk between GQD standard decoction and CID. B
  The PPI network of proteins downloaded from STRING database and imported into Cytoscape
  3.7.2. In descending degree order, node colors are blue, yellow, and orange. C The
  top 10 enriched GO terms of potential proteins of GQD standard decoction in BP,
  CC, and MF of CID. D The top 20 pathways related to the effect of GQD standard decoction
  against CID
article_title: Gegen Qinlian standard decoction alleviated irinotecan-induced diarrhea
