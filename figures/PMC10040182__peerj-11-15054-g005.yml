figure_title: The differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) associated
  competing endogenous (ceRNA) network, the proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network
  and the functional enrichment of the co-target mRNA
caption: (A) The ceRNA network of 101 pairs of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA relationships, visualized
  by Cytoscape; (B) the PPI network of the 24 co-identified target genes, acquired
  from the intersection of miRNA-predicted-mRNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs,
  and visualized by the String database (https://cn.string-db.org); (C) the GO analysis
  and (D) the KEGG analysis of the co-identified target genes.
