caption: Results of analysis between immune infiltration and KLF5 expression. A, B
  Relation between the 24 immune cells’ relative abundances and KLF5 expression level.
  C–F Tcm cells were considerably positively associated with KLF5 expression as well
  as infiltration level in various KLF5 expression groups and Th1 cells were inversely
  correlated with KLF5 expression and infiltration level in various KLF5 expression
  groups. G Cytoscape was used to build the DEG PPI network. H The KLF5 Network and
  prospective coexpression genes in KLF5-related DEGs
