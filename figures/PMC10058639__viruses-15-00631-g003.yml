caption: The PPI network of 48 potential viral ligands visualized by Cytoscape. Each
  node represents the proteinâ€™s UniProt login number. The size of the nodes corresponds
  to the connectivity degree, and the width of the edge represents the betweenness
  centrality. The membrane or secreted proteins are labeled in red. This network contains
  nine independent groups, each of which may be captured as a complex by BSDS.
