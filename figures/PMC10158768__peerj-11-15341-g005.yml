caption: (A) The PPI network generated from SRING database. (B) After importing STRING
  network to Cytoscape software, the PPI network was regenerated by default parameters,
  in which red represents up-regulated genes, and blue represents down-regulated genes.
  (C) Hub module in PPI network is identified by MCODE plug-in. (D) MCODE score of
  hub genes.
