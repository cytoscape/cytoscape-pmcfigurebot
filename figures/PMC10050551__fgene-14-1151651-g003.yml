caption: Expression of hub-genes in bone. (A) A PPI network was generated based on
  cDEGs using Cytoscape (combined score ≥ 0.9), upregulated genes are marked in dark
  red; downregulated genes are marked in dark blue. (B) The interaction network of
  the 10 nodes with the highest degree scores. The red, orange, and yellow nodes represented
  the top 10 hub genes in the network. (C) Venn diagram was mapped by the screened
  gene in PPI and the candidate genes selected by random forest algorithm and LASSO
  regression modeling, and four overlapped genes were obtained. (D) Four hub-genes
  in bone marrow tissues were verified by THPA database. It was showed high level
  of PECAM1 and ITGB3 genes in bone marrow, while COL3A1 and CD4 exhibited low level.
  (E) q-PCR results indicated that the expression levels of PECAM1 decreased significantly,
  but COL3A1; ITGB3 and CD4 had no significant difference in the expression of bone
  metastases tumor tissues. Data are shown as the mean ± SD, * means p <0.05 vs. the
  control group.
