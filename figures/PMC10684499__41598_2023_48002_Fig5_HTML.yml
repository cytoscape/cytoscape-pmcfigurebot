caption: Identification of hub genes associated with immune pathways in ARID1A-PIK3CA
  mutational co-occurrence luminal tumors. WGCNA analysis of luminal tissues exhibiting
  PIK3CA mutations (n = 780). (a) A module-trait heatmap. (b) ORA for the ‘yellow’
  module. (c) ORA for the top-ranked 5% (with trait gene significance ≥ 0.1 and module
  membership ≥ 0.8) hub genes in the ‘yellow’ module. (d) The protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) network of hub genes in the ‘yellow’ module is visualized by the Cytoscape
  software. Colored circles represent the connectivity degree of the hub gene. Darker
  colors correspond to higher degrees of connectivity. (e) The top seven key hub genes
  with the highest connectivity degrees in a STRING PPI network of the ‘yellow’ module.
  (f) mRNA expression levels of CTL4A were investigated in luminal tumors according
  to their ARID1A and PIK3CA mutation status. The RNA-seq expression dataset obtained
  from patients with coexistent ARID1A-PIK3CA mutations (n = 50) and controls (n = 897).
  The box plots display the expression distribution of CTL4A across the different
  groups. The line in the middle represents the median value (**p ≤ 0.01, Wilcoxon
  test). (g) Venn diagram showing the overlap between 135 unique DEGs genes of ARID1A-PIK3CA
  mutational co-occurrence tumors (n = 50) and the seven key hub genes.
