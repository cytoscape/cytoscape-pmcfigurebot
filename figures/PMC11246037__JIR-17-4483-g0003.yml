caption: Differential expression genes in SICM by bioinformatics analysis. (A) Venn
  diagram of DEGs in 5 mice transcriptome datasets. The 12 co-DEGs in 5 datasets were
  marked in red. 36 co-DEGs were common differences expressed in 4 datasets. (B) The
  Volcano plot of 12 co-DEGs with red indicating high expression and blue indicating
  low expression. (C) The heatmap of 36 co-DEGs expression in 5 datasets. (D) GO enrichment
  analysis of 48 co-DEGs with enrichment score. (E) KEGG enrichment analysis of the
  48 co-DEGs with enrichment score. (F) PPI network of co-DEGs constructed in STRING
  databases with Cytoscape. 14 genes including S100A8 and S100A9 showed significant
  protein interactions. The size of the circle represents the significance.
