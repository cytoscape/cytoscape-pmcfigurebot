caption: PPI network of miR-506-3p target genes (A) PPI network of miR-506-3p target
  genes were constructed by the STRING database. (B) The key genes targeted by miR-506-3p,
  including seven pivotal target genes, namely, STAT3, AKT2, BCL2L11, MEF2A, SOD2,
  FXN and HDAC4 were screened out by the cytoHubba plug-in and degree topology algorithm
  in Cytoscape software (version 3.8.0).
