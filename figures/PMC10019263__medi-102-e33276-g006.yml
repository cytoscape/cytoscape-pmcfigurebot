caption: Core PPI network. CytoNCA plug-in in Cytoscape used to filter PPI networks,
  select targets with DC, EC, CC, and BC larger than their average values, and construct
  core PPI networks. (A) Core target PPI networks exported from STRING database. (B)
  Core target PPI networks processed using Cytoscape software. The larger the DC value,
  the larger the points, the darker the color. The larger the DC value, the larger
  the points, the darker the color, and the more centered the position. BC = betweenness
  centrality, CC = cellular component, DC = degree of centrality, EC = eigenvector
  centrality, PPI = protein-protein interaction.
