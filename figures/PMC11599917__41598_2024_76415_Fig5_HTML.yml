caption: Subnetwork analysis of miR-1, miR-133a and miR-29b targets. (a) Subnetwork
  of the MTI network in Fig.  of miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-29b and their targets which
  are also upregulated in CLTI was created using Cytoscape. miRNAs are represented
  by grey nodes and mRNA targets are represented by yellow nodes; edges represent
  validated MTI from the miRTarBase database. N = total miRNA targets. (b) Venn diagram
  representation of miR-1, miR-133a and miR-29b shared targets. (c) The hub nodes
  of the PPI network in Fig  were identified in Cytoscape using CytoHubba and the
  MCC topological analysis method. The top 20 hub nodes were used to create a subnetwork.
  Node colour indicates hub node essentiality, red indicates greater hub node rank
  and yellow indicates lesser hub node rank. (d) Venn diagram representation of pro-fibrotic
  transcripts selected from the top 20 hub nodes which are targeted by miR-1, miR-133a
  and/or miR-29b.
