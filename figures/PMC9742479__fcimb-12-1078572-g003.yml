caption: 'The top three clusters of highly interconnected malonylated PPI networks.
  Interaction network of lysine-lactylated proteins (listed in gene names) were analyzed
  using the MCODE plug-in toolkit in the Cytoscape software (version 3.7.2). (A) Cluster
  1: MCODE score = 42.186, nodes = 44, edges = 907. (B) Cluster 2: MCODE score = 11.091,
  nodes = 12, edges = 61. (C) Cluster 3: MCODE score = 6, nodes = 6, edges = 15.'
