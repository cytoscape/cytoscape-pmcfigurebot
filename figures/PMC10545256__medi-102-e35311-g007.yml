caption: The PPI network and key modules for the validation dataset. (A) PPI network
  key modules constructed from NRDEGs in dataset GSE54536 by STRING and Cytoscape.
  There are 311 edges and 38 nodes in the PPI network. (B) Key modules constructed
  from NRDEGs in GSE54536 by STRING and Cytoscape. Clustering analysis of the molecular
  complex detection network with low degrees shown as bright colors. (C) Cluster heat
  maps of NRDEGs in GSE26927, GSE49036, and GSE54536. NRDEGs = necroptosis-related
  differentially expressed genes, PPI = proteinâ€“protein interaction.
