caption: (A) The PPI network of common DEGs among COVID-19, ARDS and sepsis. In the
  figure, the octagonal nodes represent DEGs and edges represent the interactions
  between nodes. The PPI network was generated using String and visualized in Cytoscape.
  (B) The hub genes were identified from the PPI network using the Cytohubba plug
  in Cytoscape. Here, the colored nodes represent the highlighted top 10 hub genes
  and their interactions with other molecules.
