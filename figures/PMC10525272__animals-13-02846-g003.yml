caption: 'Gene-level analysis showing a major PPI network being subjected to somatic
  mutations: (a) Genes targeted by somatic mutations in multiple subjects were plotted
  based on the locus of the chromosome and the degree of sharing. (b) Genes targeted
  by somatic mutations with high or moderate impact in multiple subjects. (c) PPI
  network of the named genes targeted by shared somatic variants. Nodes with no connections
  were removed for enhanced visibility, and the built-in hierarchical layout of Cytoscape
  was used.'
