caption: PPI network of downregulated DEGs and identification of hub genes. We also
  mapped downregulated DEGs to the STRING database to construct a PPI network and
  re-imported them into Cytoscape software. PPI network composed of 149 nodes and
  684 edges. Hub genes obtained by Degree algorithm, Ptprc, C1qa, Emr1, Fcgr3, and
  Ctss were considered to be key downregulated genes.
