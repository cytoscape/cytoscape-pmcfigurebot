caption: PPI network of 51 NRCRGs and the expression levels of NRCR DEGs. (A) PPI
  network demonstrating the interactions of the NRCRGs (interaction score = 0.9).
  (B) Hub genes filtrated by Cytoscape, the darker the color, the higher the connection
  degree. (C) Heatmap (presenting the expression levels of NRCR DEGs between tumor
  samples (Tumor, blue) and normal samples (Normal, red). All P < .01. DEGs = differentially
  expressed genes, NRCR = neurotransmitter release cycle-related, NRCRGs = neurotransmitter
  release cycle-related genes, PPI = protein–protein interaction.
article_title: Neurotransmitter release cycle-related genes predict the prognosis
  of lung adenocarcinoma.
