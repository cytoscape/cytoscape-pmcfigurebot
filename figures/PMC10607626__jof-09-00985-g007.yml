caption: 'Hub gene identified from the PPI networks: (a) the proteinâ€“protein interaction
  (PPI) network was constructed by STRING and Cytoscape. The node size represents
  the degree of connectivity, and the node color represents the change in the betweenness
  centrality value; (b) fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments
  (FPKMs) of the eight hub genes obtained by RNA sequencing analysis. A p-value <
  0.05 was considered statistically significant; * p < 0.01; (c) PPI network of the
  eight hub genes.'
