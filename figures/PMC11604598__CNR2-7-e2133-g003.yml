caption: Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and clusters for dynamin 2 (DNM2)
  obtained from the STRING tool and virtualized through Cytoscape software. (A) PPI
  network analysis by the STRING database revealed the interactions of DNM2 with other
  genes with the highest degree of connectivity (confidence score >0.9). The network
  includes 43 nodes and 159 edges of PPI. (B) The first cluster subnetwork was recognized
  from the PPI network using Cytoscape with the help of the MCODE plugin. The cluster
  includes 13 nodes and 29 edges.
