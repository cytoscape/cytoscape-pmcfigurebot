caption: The PPI network of intersection targets. (A) The PPI network was constructed
  by the STRING database. (B) The PPI network was modified by Cytoscape 3.9.1. The
  larger the protein node was, the darker the color, and the more lines there were,
  the greater the degree value. PPI = protein–protein interaction, STRING = search
  tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins.
