caption: The molecular interaction network (PPI network) of IPA-identified SOD1-ALS
  pathway molecules. The PPI network was constructed using STRING and analyzed with
  Cytoscape. The Cytoscape network analysis predicted ACTB followed by TP53, IL6,
  CASP3, SOD1, IL1B, APP, APOE, and VEGFA as the major network hubs. The nodesâ€™ size
  and color intensity correspond to the size of the network hub.
