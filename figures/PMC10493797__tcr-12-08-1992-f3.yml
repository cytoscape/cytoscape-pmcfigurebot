caption: PPI network of DEGs and modules identification. (A) The PPI network of DEGs
  was constructed using the STRING online database and visualized using Cytoscape,
  and DEGs with ≤3 nodes and ≤3 edges were removed from the network. (B) The most
  significant module obtained from the PPI network had 24 nodes with 275 edges. (C)
  The second significant module obtained from the PPI network had 14 nodes with 91
  edges. (D) The third significant module obtained from the PPI network had 20 nodes
  with 60 edges. (E) The fourth significant module obtained from the PPI network had
  31 nodes with 94 edges. Up-regulated genes are marked in red, and down-regulated
  genes are marked in blue. The larger size or the darker color of the node indicates
  the corresponding gene with a greater logFC. PPI, protein-protein interaction; DEG,
  differentially expressed gene; STRING, Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
  Genes; FC, fold change.
