caption: PPI network analysis of 37 FR-DEGs by Cytoscape. A PPI network constructed
  with FR-DEGs, including 34 nodes and 56 edges. Each node represents protein, and
  each edge shows interactions between these proteins. B Intersection of top 10 hub
  genesfrom the PPI network analysis ranked by four algorithms (MCC, MNC, Degree,
  and EPC). PPI, Protein-Potein Interaction; FR-DEGs, ferroptosis-related differentially
  expressed genes; MCC, Maximal Clique Centrality; MNC, Maximum Neighborhood Component;
  EPC, Edge Percolated Component
