caption: Identification of ferroptosis hub factors in ALF mRNA expression profiling
  datasets. (A) PPI network enrichment analysis was performed by Metascape. Each purple
  node represents a protein encoded by down-regulated ferroptosis-associated DEGs
  and yellow means a protein coded by up-regulated ferroptosis DEGs in patients with
  ALF. The more relationships with other proteins, the bigger the node. (B) Top ten
  hub genes identified by the cytoHubba Cytoscape plugin from 37 ferroptosis DEGs
  in three GEO datasets. The redder color means higher ranking by the MCC algorithm.
  (C) Predicted regulator network of hub genes. Red/blue/green color represents mRNA/miRNA/lncRNA.
  (D) Top ten factors identified by cytoHubba with DMNC, MNC, and clustering coefficient
  method.
