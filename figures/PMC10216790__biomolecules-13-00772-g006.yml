caption: PPI network analysis and identification of hub genes. (A) We identified the
  top hub genes (MMP9, PTGS2, CXCL8, OSM, TLN1) associated with CRPS. (B) Cytoscape
  provides basic functionality to lay out and query the network associated with CRPS;
  to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other
  molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations
  []. The potential mechanism of CRPS is analyzed via the PPI network.
