caption: CCL5 plays a critical role in several types of cancers, and its related functions
  mainly enriched in metastasis and immunology. (A) Pan-cancer analysis of CCL5 by
  TIMER 2.0, upregulated or downregulated genes in the tumors were compared with normal
  tissues for each cancer type, as displayed in gray columns when normal data were
  available; red dots indicate tumor tissue, blue dots indicate normal tissue, purple
  dots indicate metastasis tumor tissue, *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; (B) GO enrichment
  analysis; (C) KEGG pathway analysis; (D) PPI analysis. PPI network for all the overlapping
  DEGs was constructed and followed by module analysis using the MCODE plugin on the
  Cytoscape (v. 3.9.0) platform. Modules with a red border are significant modules.
  The size of circles reflects the degree of connectivity. CCL5, chemokine (C-C motif)
  ligand 5; PPI, protein-protein interaction; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  or Genes and Genomes; DEGs, differentially expressed genes.
article_title: Downregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 induced by a novel
  8-hydroxyquinoline derivative (91b1) suppresses tumor invasiveness in esophageal
  carcinoma.
