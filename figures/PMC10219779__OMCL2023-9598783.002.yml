caption: Screening of differentially expressed ferroptosis-related lncRNAs in gastric
  adenocarcinoma. (a) Heatmap of ferroptosis-related mRNA expression in gastric adenocarcinoma
  and normal tissues. (b) Volcano plot manifesting differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in ferroptosis-related mRNAs. (c) Heatmap of ferroptosis-related lncRNA expression
  in gastric adenocarcinoma and normal tissues. (d) Volcano plot manifesting DEGs
  in ferroptosis-related lncRNA. (e) The correlated network between 263 ferroptosis-related
  lncRNAs and 18 mRNAs. (f) Differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes in
  PPI. (g) The selected 12 hub genes of ferroptosis-related genes via Cytoscape.
