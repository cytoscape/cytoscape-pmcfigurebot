caption: PPI network, which was completed in the Cytoscape and CytoHubba. It consists
  of 80 nodes, and 2732 edges. The nodes represent the common targets between the
  URTI-related targets and the predicted Trollius chinensis targets. The edges represent
  the interaction between the targets. Size of the node and shades of color are proportional
  to the degree of interaction. The darker the color, the larger the figure, the higher
  and more significant the score. PPI = protein-protein interaction, URTI = upper
  respiratory tract infection.
article_title: Network pharmacology-based study on the mechanism of action of Trollius
  chinensis capsule in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection.
