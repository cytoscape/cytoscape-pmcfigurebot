caption: Gene biological functions and interactions of CDCA genes in patients with
  KIRP. (A) PPI network based on the eight CDCA proteins. (B) PPI network for CDCA
  proteins and the 80 most frequently neighboring proteins. (C) The hub genes identified
  with Cytoscape for CDCA genes and the 80 most frequently neighboring genes. (D)
  Three most significant MCODE components form PPI network and function enrichment
  analysis of three MCODE components independently among CDCA genes and the 80 most
  frequently neighboring genes. (E, F) GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses
  of CDCAs.
