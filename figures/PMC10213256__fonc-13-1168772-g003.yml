caption: PPI network complex and modular analysis of DEGs in PCa. The network nodes
  are proteins. The edges represent the predicted functional associations. (A) Using
  the STRING Website, a total of 134 DEGs (red dots represent upregulated genes and
  blue dots represent downregulated genes) were filtered into the DEGs PPI network
  complex. The node size reflects the density of the nodes and the surrounding nodes.
  (B) The most significant module was screened using MCODE in the Cytoscape software.
  The higher degree of DEGs is represented by a more intense red color.
