caption: (A) PPI network of DEGs was established by STRING (http://string-db.org)
  and visualized via Cytoscape software (version 3.9.0). The red nodes indicated upregulated
  genes and the blue nodes indicated downregulated genes. (B) Top 20 hub genes with
  a higher degree of connectivity. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the top
  20 hub genes. (D) The prognostic value (p < 0.05) of the top 20 hub genes in CRC
  patients in the disease-free survival (DFS) curve (GEPIA). (E) The expression of
  ORM1 between liver metastases and primary tumors, primary tumors, and normal tissues
  of CRC in datasets GSE14297, GSE49355, and GSE81558 respectively. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SD. ns p ≥ 0.05, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 (unpaired t test or ANOVA).
