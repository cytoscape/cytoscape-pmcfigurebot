caption: Deferentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and biological pathways upregulated
  in patients showing pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
  (A) Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of DEPs constructed using the STRING
  database. Connected nodes were visualized in Cytoscape, and node sizes were associated
  to the log fold change of the DEPs. Pink nodes were DEPs upregulated in the pCR
  group, and blue nodes denoted DEPs downregulated in the pCR group. (B) Enrichment
  analysis of the DEPs. The –log10 (p) values were visualized and color‐coded by the
  category of biological functions; light blue for mitochondrial energy metabolism,
  green for vesicle budding and vascular transportation, orange for leukocyte apoptotic
  process, purple for glucose metabolism, brick for protein localization to membranes,
  steel blue for messenger ribonucleic acid processing, and pink for cytoskeleton‐dependent
  trafficking. (C) Single‐sample GSEA scores of immune response and immune suppressive
  markers were shown by bloxplots. Patients showing PCR were indicated by gray boxes,
  whereas nonresponders were indicated by light blue boxes.
