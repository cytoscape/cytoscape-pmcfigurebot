caption: 'Constructing PPI network of potential key genes from CH to HF. (A) The PPI
  network of 35 DEGs shared in CH and HF conditions in the LA and LV; (B) Four key
  modules of the PPI network in the LA and LV; (C) The PPI network of 15 DEGs in CH
  and HF conditions is shared in the LV and RV; (D) Two key modules of the PPI network
  in the LV and RV; (E) The PPI network of 2 DEGs shared in CH and HF conditions in
  LA, LV, and RV; (F) Two key modules of the PPI network in three chambers. The modules
  are performed by the MCODE plugin in Cytoscape software. PPI: Proteinâ€“protein interaction;
  CH: Cardiac hypertrophy; HF: Heart failure; DEGs: Differentially expressed genes;
  LA: Left atrium; LV: Left ventricle; RV: Right ventricle; MCODE: Molecular complex
  detection.'
