caption: PPI network construction and hub genes extraction of DEPs. (A) The PPI network
  of the DEPs is shown. Network nodes represent proteins; edges represent protein–protein
  associations. Network analysis was set at high confidence (STRING score = 0.4) and
  high FDR stringency (0.01). Red indicates significantly increased; green indicates
  significantly decreased; width represents the degree of the interactions. (B) The
  top 10 hub genes were extracted with cytoHubba plug-in of Cytoscape software, and
  the eight algorithms are shown. Network nodes represent proteins; edges represent
  protein–protein associations. Color represents the score. MCC, Matthews Correlation
  Coefficient; DMNC, Neighborhood Component Centrality; MNC, Maximum Neighbor Connectivity;
  EPC, Edge Percolated Component.
