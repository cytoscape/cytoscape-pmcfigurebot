caption: PPI network demonstrates the PPI of the protein-coding upregulated genes
  depicted using Cytoscape. Nodes are represented as yellow elliptical shapes. Edges
  are represented as blue lines. PPI network demonstrated the PPI of the protein-coding
  gene (A) SAA1, showing one cluster in the PPI network. The PPI network had 23 nodes
  and 129 edges; (B) SAA2, showing one cluster in the PPI network. This is the densest
  network among the upregulated genes. The PPI network has 25 nodes and 236 edges;
  (C) GDF15, showing one cluster in the PPI network. It is linear in shape and the
  lightest network among upregulated genes. The PPI network has 17 nodes and 24 edges;
  and (D) USP26, showing two clusters in the PPI network. The PPI network has 26 nodes
  and 127 edges. (E) Box plot representing the number of nodes and edges of all the
  upregulated genes. PPI, protein-protein interaction; SA, serum amyloid; GDF15, growth
  differentiation factor 15; USP26, ubiquitin specific peptidase 26.
