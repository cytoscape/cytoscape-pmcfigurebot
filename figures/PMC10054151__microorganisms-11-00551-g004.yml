caption: 'PPI network analysis identified top 3 clusters and 10 hub genes dysregulated
  by both T. vaginalis and P. bivia. (A) Top three main clusters identified by Cytoscape:
  Blue and orange circles (nodes) depict putatively down- and up-regulated proteins,
  respectively. TGFBR2 (green node) had its expression predicted in both directions.
  Edges represent interactions of proteins estimated from up-regulated (pink lines)
  or down-regulated (green lines) miRNAs data sets. Cluster 1:33 nodes and 55 edges,
  cluster 2:22 nodes and 58 edges, and cluster 3:17 nodes and 48 edges (proteins are
  shown in ). Donut semicircles show proteins enriched in terms related to the female
  reproductive system (green), female reproductive gland (pink), and internal female
  genital organs (yellow) (TISSUES database). (B) PPI between the top-10 hub genes
  identified from the merged network, determined by CytoHubba according to MCC analysis.
  Colors depict centrality score from higher (red) to lower (yellow) values (values
  are shown in ). (C) EV-miRNAs targeting the 10 hub genes, plotted according to the
  total number of 3â€²UTR target sites including splicing variants (respective expression
  values are shown in ).'
