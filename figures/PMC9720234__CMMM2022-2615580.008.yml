caption: The PPI network of XFZYD on COPD. (a) The PPI network obtained from STRING
  database. (b) The PPT network analyzed by Cytoscape. The node genes with blue color
  were major genes. (c) The PPI network including the 49 major node genes. The node
  genes with blue color were core genes. (d) The PPI network including the 19 core
  node genes. The deeper the color of the node, the larger its degree value.
