caption: PPI network of common DE-mRNAs in GSE43292 and GSE97210. (A) Venn diagram
  represents that common DE-mRNAs in datasets GSE43292 and GSE97210. (B) PPI network
  of DE-mRNAs. The red circles and blue circles represent up-regulated and down-regulated
  DE-mRNAs, respectively. (C) Functional enrichment analysis was performed using Cytoscape.
  PPI, protein-protein interaction; DE-mRNAs, differentially expressed mRNAs.
