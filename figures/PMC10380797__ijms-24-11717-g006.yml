caption: Network analysis using significant psoriasis genes identified via TWAS, COLOC,
  and CONTENT. PPI was constructed using STRING and visualized using Cytoscape. Only
  networks with more than three nodes are shown. The color of the nodes indicates
  the sub-clusters assigned with the MCODE plug-in. Rhombic-shaped nodes with red
  outlines are jointly significant genes in at least one tissue panel.
