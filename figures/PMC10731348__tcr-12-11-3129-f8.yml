caption: Screening of key genes. Cytoscape software was used to visualize the entire
  PPI, draw the PPI network using node and logFC, and introduce BC to draw the protein
  interactions. The MCODE plugin in Cytoscape was used to build the functional modules.
  The results showed that three modules had a specific score >6 (A-C). The core genes
  of the three modules were ADAMTSL1, GRIN2A, and ITGAX, and the genes filtered by
  the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape were intersected with the genes of the three core
  modules to obtain the top 10 key genes (D). PPI, protein-protein interaction; BC,
  betweenness centrality; MCODE, Molecular Complex Detection; FC, fold change.
