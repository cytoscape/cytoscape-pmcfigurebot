caption: PPI Network Construction and Selection of Hub Gene. (A) Venn diagram comparison
  analysis for DEGs of 18 h, 48 h, and 72 h on live MTB-infected vs. NI group. (B)
  Identification of ten hub genes in the 18 h live MTB-infected group compared with
  18 h NI group using the plugin cytoHubba of Cytoscape evaluated with MCC scores.
  (C) Identification of ten hub genes in the 48 h live MTB-infected group compared
  with 48 h NI group using the plugin cytoHubba of Cytoscape evaluated with MCC scores.
  (D) Identification of ten hub genes in the 72 h live MTB-infected group compared
  with 72 h NI group using the plugin cytoHubba of Cytoscape evaluated with MCC scores.
  (E) Identification of ten hub genes in 1835 common DEGs using the plugin cytoHubba
  of Cytoscape evaluated with MCC scores. (F) PPI network construction on 1835 common
  DEGs was visualized by Cytoscape software. (PPI, protein-protein interactions; MTB,
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis; NI, non-infected; DEGs, differentially expressed genes;
  MCC, maximal cinque centrality)
