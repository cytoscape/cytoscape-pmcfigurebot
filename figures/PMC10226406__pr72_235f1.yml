caption: Candidate targets and PPI network construction. A) The structure of irisin.
  B) A Venn map shows the targets that irisin intersects with UC. C) The PPI networks.
  D) Import the CSV format result file of PPI into Cytoscape 3.9.1 for visualization.
  High-degree nodes are larger and closer to red, while low-degree nodes are smaller
  and closer to yellow. E) GO enrichment analysis. The Y-axis shows the enriched count
  and the X-axis shows significantly enriched GO terms of the intersectional targets.
  F) Component-target network of irisin.
