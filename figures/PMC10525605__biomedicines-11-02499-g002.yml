caption: PPI network analysis and screening for hub genes. Using the MCODE tool of
  Cytoscape software, the top 3 modules in the PPI network were identified. (A) Module
  1 and its GO annotations; (B) module 2 and its GO annotations; (C) module 3 and
  its GO annotations. (D) The 30 selected hub genes were constructed into a new PPI
  network using STRING and Cytoscape.
