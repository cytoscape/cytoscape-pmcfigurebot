caption: Obtained core targets of AM towards HAPC. (A) PPI network of drug–disease
  intersection targets. The minimum required interaction score was set to 0.7 by the
  STRING database. (B) Visualization of the PPI network by Cytoscape. No-edge nodes
  have been removed. (C) Top 15 targets in the PPI network ranked by degree. (D) Venn
  diagram showed the core targets. Targets meeting BC ≥ 10.95 (median), CC ≥ 0.145
  (median), and DC ≥ 7 (median) were screened.
