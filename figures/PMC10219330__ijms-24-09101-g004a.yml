caption: Proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network of miR-16-5p (A), miR-145-5p (B),
  and miR-20a-5p (C) strong validated targets. The targets were retrieved from miRTargetLink
  2.0 and the PPI was generated using the STRINGapp Protein Query from Cytoscape 3.9.1
  and by applying Markov clustering (MCL).
