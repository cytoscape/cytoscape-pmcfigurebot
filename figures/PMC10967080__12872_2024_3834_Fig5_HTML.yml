caption: PPI network analysis of hub genes. A PPI network.from STRING database. B
  PPI network circles represented proteins and lines represented interactions between
  proteins. Ten hub genes were in colour. The red depth means the degree of importance.
  C Results scored 9.647 using the MCODE plugin in Cytoscape. D Results scored 5.4
  using the MCODE plugin in Cytoscape; PPI, protein–protein interaction
