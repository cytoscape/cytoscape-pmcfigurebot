caption: The proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network constructed via the STRING
  database for the DEGs. (A) PPI network of the 79 co-mRNAs. (B) PPI network of the
  26 ce-mRNAs. (C) The top modules networks were identified by Cytoscape MCODE. Both
  the 79 co-mRNA and the 26 ce-mRNA list showed the same top modules. The shades of
  color (yellow to red) represent the degree to which the molecules interact. (D)
  Genes from the DEGs (co-mRNAs and ce-mRNAs) based on the PPI network analysis with
  the degree of interaction in the PPI network hub nodes.
