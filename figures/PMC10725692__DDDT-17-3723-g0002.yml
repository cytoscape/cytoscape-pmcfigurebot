caption: Potential targets of Jin Gu Lian capsule for the treatment of rheumatoid
  arthritis. (A) Venn diagram of compound targets and disease targets. (B) The protein–protein
  interaction (PPI) network was constructed and visualized by Cytoscape 3.8.0. Hub
  genes resided in the inner layer of the network. The size and color of the nodes
  were based on degree. The degree value from large to small followed a continuous
  mapping from red to yellow.
