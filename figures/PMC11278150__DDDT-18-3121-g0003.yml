caption: PPI network of celastrol-HCC-ferroptosis genes. (A) Venn diagram illustrating
  the common targets of celastrol (Cel), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and ferroptosis
  (FerrDb). FerrDb is the world’s first database that is dedicated to ferroptosis
  regulators and ferroptosis-disease associations. Here, “FerrDb” represents all genes
  associated with ferroptosis. (B) PPI network generated in Cytoscape 3.9.1 by importing
  the STRING data for 31 shared targets. (C) Core gene cluster filtered by MCODE plugin
  in Cytoscape 3.9.1. Blue and red rectangular nodes together represent 31 common
  targets. The red nodes are the selected core gene cluster. Nodes are marked as corresponding
  ranks and larger circles indicate more important roles in the network.

  the Efficacy of Celastrol Against Hepatocellular Carcinoma Through Ferroptosis.
