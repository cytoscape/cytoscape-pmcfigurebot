caption: Protein–protein interaction network analysis of differentially expressed
  proteins in SH-SY5Y cells after SIRT4 overexpression. (A) Histogram of the top 10
  active proteins in the PPI network analysis of upregulated proteins according to
  the betweenness centrality. (B) Histogram of the top 10 active proteins in the PPI
  network analysis of downregulated proteins according to the betweenness centrality.
  (C) Visual display of the PPI network analysis of upregulated proteins. (D) Visual
  display of the PPI network analysis of downregulated proteins. A network of interactions
  from the STRING database with a confidence score >0.7 (high confidence) was visualized
  in Cytoscape. The betweenness centrality was calculated based on the Cytoscape plug-in
  CytoNCA. The size of the circle represents the number of proteins interacting with
  the corresponding differentially expressed proteins.
