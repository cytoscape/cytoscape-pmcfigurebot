figure_title: PPI analysis of genes selected from modules with | Z score | ≥ 2 genes
caption: These genes are from the yellow module (30 genes, fill colour is yellow),
  red module (29 genes, fill colour is red), tan module (18 genes, fill colour is
  tan) and turquoise module (78 genes, fill colour is turquoise). The ’circle’ shape
  represents the top 5 genes when | Z-Score | > 0, with a total of 10 genes, and is
  labelled ’Top10’. The shape "V" represents the seed genes used to build the PPI
  network genes when the core subnetwork is calculated by the Cytoscape plugin MCODE,
  and is labelled "seed". The ’diamond’ shape represents the gene used to build the
  PPI network gene by the Cytoscape plugin Cytohubba to calculate the Degree, EPC,
  MCC and MNC values of each gene and retain the intersection of the top 20 genes
  for each gene to obtain a total of 11 hub genes, labelled ’hub’. The ’square’ shape
  represents the other genes used to construct the PPI network. The large outer circle
  represents the non-core subnetwork genes and the three modules inside the circle
  (from most to least number of genes) are the three core subnetworks with scores
  of 5.6, 4.5 and 2.8 respectively.
