caption: Eight differential genes were selected as potential pathogenic genes for
  COPD. A 23 overlapping genes were identified at the intersection of the negatively
  correlated gene set, and seven overlapping genes were found in the positively correlated
  gene set. B Display of the enrichment results for Molecular Function (MF), Biological
  Process (BP), Reactome, and KEGG pathways of 30 overlapping genes, with p-values
  represented as log10 values. C Schematic representation of the PPI network of RRA
  genes according to the 30 overlapping genes. Top 15 hub genes screened by Cytobubba
  plugin with Cytoscape according to the PPI network. D Gene selection by the LASSO
  regression according to the occurrence of COPD in GSE47460. E Eight overlapping
  genes were identified after intersecting the results from five machine learning
  methods (SVM-RFE, LASSO Model, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Random Forest
  Model). F The coefficient values of the 8 genes from the LASSO Model, Ridge Regression,
  Elastic Net, and Random Forest Model results. G The expression of 8 overlapping
  genes in GSE47460 (left) and GSE125521 (right). Data are expressed as mean ± SD.
  P values shown in charts determined by a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (G)
