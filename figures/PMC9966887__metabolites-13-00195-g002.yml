caption: The PPI network for Gelsemium alkaloids in excitotoxicity. (a) PPI among
  the 214 core targets. The network nodes represent targets, while the edges represent
  proteinâ€“protein associations. (b) PPI network of the core hub targets using Cytoscape
  3.6.0 software. The different colors indicate the different importance of the nodes
  in the whole PPI network. The redder the ellipse is, the more important the node
  is in the PPI network.
