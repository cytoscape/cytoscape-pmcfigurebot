caption: 'Effect of physical exercise on transcriptomic up-expression in tarsal joints
  of mice with collagen-induced arthritis. The lists of the up-expressed genes in
  the CIA-Ex mice with respect to control (Z-score ≥ 1.5 SD) were analyzed on DAVID
  bioinformatics resource, STRING database, and Cytoscape software (n = 8 mice per
  group). (a) The associated KEGG pathways (p ≤ 0.05) in DAVID are shown in the bars
  that indicate the -Log10 (p-value) and the number of genes on the right side of
  each bar. (b) The primary clusters of sub-networks found with the Molecular Complex
  Detection (MCODE) complement (cutoff = 0.4) to obtain the protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) network. (c) KEGG signaling pathways relevant in arthritis. (d) Amplification
  of the nodes with the most significant interaction in the selected pathways. FDR:
  false discovery rate.'
