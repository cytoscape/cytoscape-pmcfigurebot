caption: Proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network of RPD against IBS and UC. (A)
  The interactive PPI network acquired from STRING database platform. (B) PPI network
  imported from STRING database to Cytoscape 3.8.0. (C) The PPI network of more significant
  proteins is composed of 31 nodes and 153 edges. (D) Core PPI network containing
  13 nodes and 56 edges. A node with a larger size and deeper color possesses a higher
  degree value, such as JUN, TP53, MAPK1, RELA, and MYC.
