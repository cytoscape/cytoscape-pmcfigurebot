caption: Interaction network, expression analysis, survival analysis, and stage-wise
  expression of ITGA3 and PKM in HCC. (A) Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in high-risk and low-risk groups.
  The network was constructed using the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape
  software. (B) Comparison of ITGA3 expression levels between normal and tumor samples.
  (C) Comparison of PKM expression levels between normal and tumor samples. (D) Survival
  curves for patients with high and low PKM expression. (E) Survival curves for patients
  with high and low ITGA3 expression. (F) Comparison of PKM expression levels across
  different tumor stages. (G) Comparison of ITGA3 expression levels across different
  tumor stages. The symbols *** represent P-values of < 0.001.
