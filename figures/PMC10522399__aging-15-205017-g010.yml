caption: The construction of the PPI network and an analysis of IL18RAP's functional
  enrichment in cancers. (A, B) The PPI network (A) of IL18RAP constructed by Cytoscape,
  and the top 10 hub genes (B) of PPI were selected using cytoHubba plugins. (C) The
  correlation between the top 10 hub genes with IL18RAP in 33 types of cancers was
  calculated using Spearman correlation analysis. (D) The GO/KEGG enrichment analyses
  of the top 10 hub genes. (E) The relationship between IL18RAP and 10 famous cancer-related
  pathways was analyzed via GSCALite platform. The results of IL18RAP were circled
  in the black box.
