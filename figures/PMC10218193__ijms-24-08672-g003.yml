caption: 'Integrative analysis of PLS-DA and PPI network analysis. (A) Flow chart
  of the integrative bioinformatics analysis. (B) PCA of 6106 DEGs from new classified
  groups (NR, AR, and HC). (C) PLS-DA score plot of the first two principal components
  for 6106 DEGs from samples of MUD patients (NR and AR) and HC. (D) Venn diagram
  of DEGs with a VIP score of 1.0 or higher for each component in the PLS-DA model.
  (E) PPI network of 1291 DEGs using STRING and Cytoscape. The network nodes represent
  proteins, and edges indicate the predicted functional associations between nodes.
  (F) Network centrality analysis for screening of hub genes (DC = 4.48 and BC = 0.00064).
  DC: degree centrality; BC: betweenness centrality.'
