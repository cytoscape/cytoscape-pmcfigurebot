caption: Network pharmacology analysis of the neuroprotective effects of phenolic
  components in H. citrina leaves ((A) Venn diagram of phenolic components in H. citrina
  leaves and neuroprotective targets; (B) PPI network; (C) Network of “H. citrina
  leaves Phenolic Components - Common Targets – Neuroprotection”; (D) GO biological
  function enrichment; (E) KEGG pathway enrichment; (F) Network of “H. citrina leaves
  Phenolic Components - Common Targets - Pathways.” The component targets and disease
  targets information were searched through databases, and result graph were drew
  by Cytoscape software and Microbioinformatics Platform (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/)).
