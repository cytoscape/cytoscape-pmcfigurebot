caption: Functional PPI networks. The differentially methylated modules consist of
  a network of genes based on their functional connectivity using PPI. Each module
  has a primary gene that is connected to other target genes in the network. Each
  module was significant p < 0.05 using the Functional Epigenetic Module method. GraphNEL
  networks were exported from the modified FEM R package to Cytoscape (version 3.8)
  using RCy3 and further annotated. Node colour represents methylation state; blue
  nodes show hypermethylation, with yellow representing hypomethylation. A different
  colour of the node border refers to differential expression; those with red borders
  are upregulated, those with green are downregulated. Edge widths are proportional
  to the average statistic of the PPI network. (A) The bmpr1aa/smad3b/smad4a module
  is associated with BMP and TGFβ signalling pathways and was reported to be significant
  through three different seed genes. (B) The tfpd2/cdk6 module is associated with
  cell cycle regulation, identified twice with individual seed genes.
