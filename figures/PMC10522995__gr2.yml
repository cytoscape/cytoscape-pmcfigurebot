caption: Volcano plot and PPI network. Differentially regulated proteins from independent
  datasets and enrichment analysis of Crtc2LKO. A, the volcano plot shows the log2
  fold change (log2FC) versus the p-value plot (-log10p-value). B, protein–protein
  interaction network of differentially expressed (log2FC > ±0.26 with -log10pvalue
  >1.3), differentially phosphorylated (log2FC > ±0.26 with -log10pvalue >1.3), and
  differentially acetylated (log2FC > ±0.26 with −log10pvalue >1.3) proteins from
  Crtc2LKO phenotype. The PPI network was created using the STRING app in Cytoscape
  with a 0.4 confidence level and without additional interactions. The edge color
  refers to the strength of interaction. The node-filled color corresponds to the
  log2FC value, where blue indicates downregulated, red indicates upregulated, and
  white is nonsignificant expression/nonidentification. The proteins are grouped based
  on mouse KEGG pathways, and single nodes are hidden for clarity. Acet, acetylome;
  Phos, phosphoproteome; Prot, proteome.
