caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) examination of potential proteins that
  may interact with Six1. (A) Human SIX1 PPI network was analyzed and visualized by
  STRING and Cytoscape. (B) Mouse Six1 PPI network was analyzed and visualized by
  STRING and Cytoscape. (C) Gene ontology (GO) cell component term analysis of human
  SIX1 interacted proteins based on PPI analysis. (D) GO cell component term analysis
  of mouse Six1 interacted proteins based on PPI analysis. (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of human Six1 interacted proteins based on
  PPI analysis. (F) KEGG analysis of mouse Six1 interacted proteins based on PPI analysis.
  Asterisk (*) indicates significant difference with p<0.01, and the blue-colored
  part indicates p<0.05.
