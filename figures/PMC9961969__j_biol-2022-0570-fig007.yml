caption: PPI network of upregulated DEGs and identification of hub genes. We mapped
  upregulated DEGs to the STRING database to construct a PPI network, and then re-imported
  these interactive network data into Cytoscape software. PPI network composed of
  97 nodes and 210 edges. Hub genes obtained by the Degree algorithm, Cpt1b, Acadl,
  Eci2, Mlycd, and Pdk4 were considered to be key upregulated genes.
