caption: PPI network demonstrates the PPIs of the protein-coding downregulated genes
  depicted using Cytoscape. Nodes are represented as green elliptical shapes. Edges
  are represented by blue lines. PPI network demonstrates the PPIs of the protein-coding
  gene (A) TIE1, showing two clusters in the PPI networks. One main cluster has two
  sub-clusters, with one demonstrating no interactions with the gene of interest.
  The PPI network has 23 nodes and 52 edges; (B) CACNA2D1, showing one cluster in
  the PPI networks. The PPI network has 16 nodes and 101 edges; (C) CAPN6, showing
  two clusters in the PPI networks. One main cluster has two sub-clusters, with one
  demonstrating no interactions with the gene of interest. The PPI network has 21
  nodes and 41 edges; and (D) ADAMTS6, showing one cluster of the PPI network. The
  PPI network has 23 nodes and 51 edges. (E) Box plot representing the number of nodes
  and edges of all the downregulated genes. PPI, protein-protein interaction; TIE1,
  tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains
  1; CACNA2D1, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit α2Δ1; CAPN6, calpain
  6; ADAMTS6, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 6.
