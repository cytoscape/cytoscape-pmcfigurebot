figure_title: Cul4b is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc in CD8+ T cells
caption: a Quantitative proteomics analysis of c-Myc-deficient (c-MyccKO) and control
  CD8+ T cells stimulated for 24 h with anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs. The DAVID functional annotation
  tool was used to perform a gene-annotation enrichment analysis of the set of differentially
  expressed genes (adjusted p-value < 0.05) between c-MyccKO and control CD8+ T cells.
  The bubble plot depicts the enriched functional networks of proteins. The z-score
  is assigned to the x-axis and the negative logarithm of the adjusted p-value to
  the y-axis (the higher, the more significant). The size/area of the displayed circles
  is proportional to the number of genes assigned to the term. Red, significantly
  enriched GO terms related to cell cycle and the DNA damage response; Green, Translation
  and Transcription related terms among the top ten terms. GO terms outside top ten
  are shown in gray. p-values were calculated using two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests,
  corrected for multiple comparisons via Bonferroni correction. b, c Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) showing GO biological processes related to the cellular response
  to DNA damage and DNA repair in control over c-MyccKO CD8+ T cells. p-values represent
  probability of overrepresentation via two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests. p-values
  were corrected for multiple comparisons via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Normalized
  enrichment score (NES) reflects the degree to which the gene set is overrepresented
  at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes, normalized for gene set size and
  correlations between the gene set and expression dataset. NES was calculated via
  GSEA. d The construction of the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network for proteins
  associated with biological terms cell cycle, DNA repair, and cellular response to
  DNA damage were superimposed with the scored protein interaction data from STRING
  and these were then visualized in Cytoscape (v. 3.9.1). The 1st and 2nd degree interactors
  of c-Myc are shown, green depicts direct interactors of c-Myc while orange depicts
  direct interactors of Cul4b. e The heatmap showing protein abundance (copy number)
  of CRL4B components in naïve, TCR activated control (WT) and c-Myc-deleted CD8+
  T cells. f Naïve CD8+ T cells from control and c-MyccKO mice were activated with
  anti-CD3/CD28 plus ICAM1 for 36 h. A volcano plot of gene profiles in c-MyccKO versus
  control CD8+ T cells as determined using RNA-seq analysis. Differentially regulated
  Cul4b components are highlighted. Student’s t-tests were performed to identify differentially
  regulated genes between control and c-MyccKO samples, p-value < 0.001 were considered
  significant. g c-Myc ChIP-seq tracks at the Cul4b, and adapter protein (Ddb1) gene
  loci in WT CD8+ T cells (top, gene structures and transcriptional orientations).
  c-Myc binding peaks, identified by the Model based Analysis for ChIP-seq (MACS)
  algorithm, are marked by rectangles. Source data are provided as a “Source Data”
  file.
