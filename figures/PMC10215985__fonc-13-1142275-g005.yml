caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. (A) PPI network was
  constructed with DEGs from GEO and TCGA datasets that show the interaction between
  hub genes by STRING software. (B) LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network by Cytoscape software.
  The network includes 29 nodes and 88 edges. The yellow ellipse, blue ellipse, and
  purple ellipse oval represent lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, respectively.
article_title: A systematic method introduced a common lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in
  the different stages of prostate cancer.
