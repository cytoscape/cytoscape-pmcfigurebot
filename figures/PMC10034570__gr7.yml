caption: 'Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and GO-BP enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed proteins in EVsSTRING v.11.5 (https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl)
  was used to analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of differentially
  expressed proteins (medium confidence score = 0.4). STRING PPI network was used
  for cluster and GO (BP) enrichment analysis using Cytoscape plugin MCODE (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/MCODE)
  (degree cutoff = 2, cluster finding: haircut, node score cutoff = 0.2, K-core =
  2, maximum [max.] depth = 100). CytoHubb plugin was used to extract to hub genes
  in the PPI network clusters. (A) Significant clusters from the PPI network and enriched
  GO-BP terms of BM-MSC vs. UC-MSC differentially expressed proteins. (B) Significant
  clusters from the PPI network and enriched GO-BP terms of HDC vs. UC-MSC differentially
  expressed proteins. The orange diamonds indicate nodes, gray lines indicate edges,
  and the blue diamonds indicate hub node genes. The PPI networks of differentially
  expressed proteins among cell types are presented in .'
