caption: The identification of hub genes by PPI network and Cytoscape. A. The PPI
  network constructed by 46 differentially expressed mRNAs with a linear relationship.
  B. One module from the PPI network with tight clusters was analyzed using the plugin
  MCODE in Cytoscape. The hub genes were shown in yellow. C. The top 10 identified
  hub genes screened by the plugin cytoHubba in Cytoscape are displayed from a high
  degree value (red) to a low degree value (yellow).
