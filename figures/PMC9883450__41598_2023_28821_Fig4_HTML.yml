caption: Protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis. (A) Protein–protein interaction
  network of Aspiletreins and NSCLC targets obtained from STRING v_11.5 database.
  (B) The PPI network was constructed using the plug-in targets from the STRING database
  and imported into Cytoscape. (C) The top 5 targets in the PPI network as ranked
  using the cytoHubba plug in network analyzer. The higher degree value is represented
  by colors ranging from red to yellow.
