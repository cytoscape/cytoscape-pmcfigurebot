caption: PPI network construction and the module analysis. A The figure represents
  a Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) network constructed using a molecular interaction
  list obtained from the STRING database. The size of the circles indicates the number
  of protein interactions; the larger the circle, the darker the color. B The key
  gene sets were obtained through the MCODE plug-in of Cytoscape software. C The MCC
  algorithm on cytoHubba plug-in of Cytoscape software was used to obtain the Top20
  most closely related Hub gene collections
