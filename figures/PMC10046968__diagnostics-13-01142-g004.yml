caption: Important sub-networks and nodes obtained from cytohubba plug-in of Cytoscape
  software using six topological algorithms. The top 15 hub genes were evaluated in
  the PPI network using these six calculation methods. Red color circles represent
  the hub genes of interest in this study, and green color circles represent the adjoining
  genes obtained from network. (a) Sub-network obtained from closeness topological
  algorithm. The nodes in red represent the top-ranked hub genes. (b) Sub-network
  and hub genes obtained from degree topological algorithm. (c) Sub-network and hub
  genes obtained from EPC topological algorithm. (d) Sub-network and hub genes obtained
  from MCC topological algorithm. (e) Sub-network and hub genes obtained from MNC
  topological algorithm. (f) Sub-network and hub genes obtained from radiality topological
  algorithm. The hub genes are shown in red color in all 6 topologies.
