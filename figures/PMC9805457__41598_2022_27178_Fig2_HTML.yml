caption: 'Partition of PPI network and distribution of each group in PPI network.
  (a,e,i,m) PPI network of DEGs in the Skeletal muscle denervation dataset, Prostate
  cancer dataset, Alzheimer''s disease dataset and Gastric cancer dataset. The degree
  of each node was calculated. The larger the degree of the node, the darker the color
  and the closer the position is to the center. The top 20% nodes are defined as core
  regions, the top 20%-50% nodes are defined as sub core regions, and the remaining
  nodes are noncore regions. (b,f,j,n) Distribution of FC group in PPI network. (c,g,k,o)
  Distribution of p-value group in PPI network. (d,h,l,p) Distribution of C value
  group in PPI network. Red is the selected node, blue is the unselected. Number of
  genes in core region, sub core region and noncore region of each group has been
  tagged. STRING v11.0 was used to generate protein interactions, and the resulting
  network was visualized using Cytoscape v3.7.2. (FC group: the collection of the
  top10 FC miRNAs’ predictive target mRNAs; p-value group: the collection of the top10
  p-value miRNAs’ predictive target mRNAs; C value group: the collection of the top10
  C value miRNAs’ predictive target mRNAs).'
