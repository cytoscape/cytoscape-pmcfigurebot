caption: Bioinformatics analysis of overlapping genes. (A) Venn diagram of 84 overlapping
  genes between the predicted targets of Lut and the targets associated with ALI/ARDS.
  (B) PPI network of the 84 overlapping genes. The importance of each gene was analyzed
  by STRING. The higher the degree, the more crucial the gene. The degree of the outermost
  circle is 0–10, the middle circle is 11–20, and the smallest circle is >20. The
  colors of nodes from reddish to yellowish are arranged in descending order on the
  basis of their degree values. (C) Cytohubba, the plug-in of Cytoscape, was used
  to analyze the top 10 hub gene network of target proteins by MCC algorithm. (D)
  Cluster of the 84 overlapping gene-containing PPI network. Three clusters were identified.
  Cluster 1 had the highest score of 10.08, and JAK2 was identified as the seed gene.
  Cluster 2 had a score of 3.5, and ALB was the seed gene. Cluster 3 had a score of
  3.2, and EGFR was the seed gene.
