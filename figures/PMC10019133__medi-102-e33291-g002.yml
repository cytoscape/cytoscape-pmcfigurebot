caption: PPI network constructed by STRING online database and visualized by Cytoscape.
  (A) PPI network without isolated or partially disconnected nodes. (B) Module analysis
  via Cytoscape software (degree cutoff = 2, node score cutoff = 0.2, k-core = 2,
  and max. Depth = 100). (C) Selection of hub genes using the plug-in cytoHubba of
  Cytoscape. All of them were upregulated genes. PPI = protein-protein interaction.

  cancer by bioinformatics tools.
