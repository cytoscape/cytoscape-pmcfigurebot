caption: Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
  (A) Construct the PPI network of DEGs using STRING online database and utilize Cytoscape
  software for analysis. (B) MCC was used to identify the central gene. (C) MNC was
  used to identify the central gene. (D) DMNC was used to identify the central gene.
  (E) EPC was used to identify the central gene. (F) EcCentricity was used to identify
  the central gene. (G) Core genes (Tsc22d3, Itga6, Ermn, Sult1a1) were obtained by
  merging using Venn diagrams.
