caption: CACNA1A may participate in angiogenesis in PDR by regulating the expression
  of VEGFA. (A) The PPI network diagram of PDR angiogenesis-related genes was constructed
  using the STRING database. (B) The PPI network diagram of the number of associated
  genes of each gene. (C) The PPI network diagram of CACNA1A-regulated angiogenesis
  in PDR constructed by Cytoscape software.
