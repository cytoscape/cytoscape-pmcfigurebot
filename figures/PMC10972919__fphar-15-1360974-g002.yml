caption: Venn diagram, volcano plot, GO term enrichment, KEGG pathway enrichment,
  PPI network, and hub genes of AF- and NAFLD-related DEGs. (A) Venn diagram showcasing
  DEGs associated with AF and NAFLD. (B) Volcano plot of AF-related DEGs. Gray points
  correspond to adjusted p > 0.05; red points denote upregulated genes with adjusted
  p < 0.05; green points represent downregulated genes with adjusted p < 0.05. (C)
  GO term enrichment for co-down-regulated DEGs linked to AF and NAFLD. Dot size indicates
  the count of enriched DEGs; dot color reflects the q value. (D) KEGG pathway of
  co-DEGs related to AF and NAFLD. Dot size denotes the count of enriched DEGs; dot
  color illustrates the q value. (E) Cytoscape software calculated the hub genes of
  co-DEGs. Red indicates a higher MCC score; blue signifies a lower MCC score. Rectangles
  represent co-up-regulated DEGs; ellipses correspond to co-down-regulated DEGs. (F)
  Hub genes of co-DEGs are ranked by the MCC method. GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; PPI, protein-protein interaction; AF, atrial
  fibrillation; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; DEGs, differentially expressed
  genes.
