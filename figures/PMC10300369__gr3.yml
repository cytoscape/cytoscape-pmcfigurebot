caption: Sorafenib treatment significantly upregulates the expression of TRIB3 and
  STC2 in HCC cells by identification DEGs. Using the STRING online database and Cytoscape,
  upregulated genes in the sorafenib groups were filtered into the DEG PPI network
  complex. Hub genes were marked in red, other linked genes were marked in blue. (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
  to the Web version of this article.)
