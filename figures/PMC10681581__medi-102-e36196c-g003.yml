caption: Screening core components and core objectives of DTDP in the treatment of
  DN. (A) Venn diagram of the intersection of the DTDP target and DN genes. PPI network
  was constructed with STRING. (B) The PPI network of the 22 intersecting targets
  was constructed using Cytoscope software. Each node’s color denotes the degree,
  from red (highest) to yellow (lowest), as the node degree decreases. (C) Screening
  the top 10 core genes in the network according to the degree. (D) the degree of
  top 10 core genes were drawn by Bar graph. (E) Screening core components. In the
  Cytoscape software, components corresponding to 22 interleaved targets are extracted
  from the component-target network of DTDP, and the PPI network screening graph was
  drawn based on the ranking of the degree values. (F) The histogram shows the degree
  value of the top 19 core components. DC = degree centrality, DN = diabetes nephropathy,
  DTDP = Dahuang-Tusizi drug pair, PPI= protein–protein interaction.
