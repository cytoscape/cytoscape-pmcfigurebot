caption: 'PPI network construction and hub gene screening. (a) The PPI network of
  DEGs was depicted using the Cytoscape software. Upregulated genes were labeled in
  red, and downregulated genes were labeled in green. (b) Ten hub genes were screened
  using the cytoHubba plug-in. Abbreviations: DEGs, differently expressed genes; PPI:
  proteinâ€“protein interaction.'
