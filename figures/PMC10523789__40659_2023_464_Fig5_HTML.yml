caption: Construction of PPI network of DEPRGs and identification of hub genes a Using
  the STRING online database, the PPI network of 12 DEPRGs was constructed, concluding
  12 nodes and 48 edges. Each node represents a protein and each edge represents the
  interaction between two proteins. b Identification of only one sub-network by MCODE
  plugin in Cytoscape. c Identification of 6 hub genes with the highest degree identified
  by four algorithms (MCC, MNC, Degree and EPC) from CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape
