caption: Venn diagram, PPI network, and the most significant module of DEGs. (A) DEGs
  were selected with a fold change > 2 and P value < .001 among the mRNA expression
  profiling sets GSE143939, GSE196006, and GSE200427. The three datasets showed an
  overlap of 241 genes. (B) The most significant module. (C) The PPI network of DEGs
  was constructed using Cytoscape. Upregulated genes are marked in light red; downregulated
  genes are kept in light blue. DEGs = differentially expressed genes, PPI = protein-protein
  interaction.
