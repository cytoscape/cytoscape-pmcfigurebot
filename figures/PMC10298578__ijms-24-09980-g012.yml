caption: (a1–a3) The PPI network of DEGs in NPCs, neurons, and astrocytes, respectively,
  were constructed using Cytoscape. Red represents the REST-targeted upregulated genes,
  green represents the REST-targeted downregulated genes, yellow represents the non-REST-targeted
  upregulated genes, and purple represents the non-REST-targeted downregulated genes.
  The larger the network node degree distribution, the larger the shape. (b1–b3, c1–c3,
  d1–d3) are the top three models obtained using the MCODE plug-in of Cytoscape in
  neuron DEGs in NPCs, neurons, and astrocytes, respectively. (e1–e3) The GO enrichment’s
  most significant five terms were shown in each top three critical models in neuron
  DEGs.
