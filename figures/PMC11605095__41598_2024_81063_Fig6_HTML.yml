caption: Key targets of SANG in the treatment of CA. (A) Describes the construction
  of a PPI network utilizing the String 12.0 database, setting a minimum interaction
  score threshold of 0.7 to ensure high confidence. After removing isolated nodes
  from the network, we obtained a PPI network consisting of 35 therapeutic targets
  of SANG effective against CA. (B-G) Illustrates the top 6 key targets identified
  by six distinct algorithms namely MCC, Degree, EPC, EcCentricity, Closeness, and
  Betweenness, utilizing Cytoscape 3.10.0 software. (H) The UpSet plot elucidates
  the overlapping relationships among the top 6 targets chosen by the aforementioned
  six algorithms.
