caption: 'RECK modulates the expression level of CALD1 via influencing the phosphorylation
  level of ERK. A The PPI network based on genes associated with RECK was constructed
  by the STRING platform and Cytoscape 3.9 software. B The bar plot depicts the number
  of adjacent nodes per gene according to the STRING platform. C Three genes from
  the PPI network were directly related to RECK. Cor: the coefficient for correlation
  analysis. Score: combined score derived from STRING platform. D–F The downregulation
  of CALD1 in GC was verified by qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical
  assay from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). G The phosphorylation level of CALD1 was
  performed by Western blot analysis in AGS and HGC-27 cells with the treatment of
  TBHQ or PD98059. H The effect of alterations in RECK gene expression on the phosphorylation
  level of CALD1 in AGS and HGC-27 cells (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ns = not
  significant)'
