caption: PPI network construction and module analysis. The PPI network of DEGs was
  constructed in Cytoscape. The most significant module was obtained by MCODE plug-in.
  (A) module score:10; (B) module score:8.6. (C) PPI network for the top 10 hub genes
  analyzed by cytoHubba. (D) The cohesive regulatory interaction network of DEGs-TFs
  obtained from the NetworkAnalyst. The square nodes represented TFs, and gene symbols
  interact with TFs as circle nodes. (E) qRT-PCR was performed to detect the levels
  of hub genes in cell model. Results were represented as mean ± SEM (n = 6, *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, or NS).
