figure_title: Co-expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) of CYP1B1
caption: (A) Co-expression network of CYP1B1 constructed by GeneMANIA plugin of Cytoscape.
  In the constructed network, the size of the node represents the degree of co-expression.
  The higher the degree of co-expression, the bigger the size of the node. (B) The
  protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of CYP1B1. (C) A network of hub candidates
  predicted to be highly interacted with CYP1B1 by the cytoHubba plugin Cytoscape
  software.
