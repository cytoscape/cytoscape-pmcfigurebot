caption: Protein−protein interaction (PPI) network of the differentially expressed
  genes of metabolism-related proteins (MP−DEGs) and screening of hub genes. (A) The
  STRING database was used to construct the PPI network of MP−DEGs, with 69 nodes
  and 72 edges. (B) The node gene cluster with the highest score, constructed using
  the MCODE plug-in in Cytoscape, consists of nine genes. (C) CytoHubba was used to
  construct the top 10 hub genes. The figure shows the top 10 hub genes constructed
  with the maximal clique centrality (MCC) method. (D) CytoHubba was used to predict
  the first−stop node genes that interact with FASN. In total, 10 genes were predicted,
  of which one was upregulated and nine were downregulated.
