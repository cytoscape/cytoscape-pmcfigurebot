caption: PPI network of the protein-coding downregulated and upregulated genes. (A)
  PPI network demonstrating the PPI of protein-coding downregulated and upregulated
  genes (TIE1, CACNA2D1, CAPN6, ADAMTS6, SAA2, GDF15, SAA1, and USP26), depicted using
  Cytoscape. Nodes are represented as pink elliptical shapes. Edges are represented
  as blue lines. A total of one cluster is shown in the PPI network. The PPI network
  has 35 nodes and 241 edges. (B) Bar diagram representing the number of nodes and
  edges of the PPI network. PPI, protein-protein interaction; TIE1, tyrosine kinase
  with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains 1; CACNA2D1, calcium
  voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit α2Δ1; CAPN6, calpain 6; ADAMTS6, a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 6; SA, serum amyloid; GDF15, growth
  differentiation factor 15; USP26, ubiquitin specific peptidase 26.
