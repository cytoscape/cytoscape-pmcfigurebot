caption: PPI network plot and hub genes of ER stress-related DEGs. (A) The PPI network
  of ER stress-related DEGs was visualized by Cytoscape software. (B) The hub genes
  were identified with the MCC score using cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape software.
  PPI proteinâ€“protein interaction, ER endoplasmic reticulum, DEGs differentially expressed
  genes.
