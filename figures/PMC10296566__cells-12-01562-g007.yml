caption: 'Network analysis. Proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network of the proteins
  obtained combining LDA and MAProMa results. Physical or/and functional interactions
  are highlighted by thicker edges and considering experimental (STRING score > 0.15)
  and database (STRING score > 0.35) annotated interactions. The networks were visualized
  by Cytoscape v.3.9.1 software, while biological processes were retrieved by STRING
  enrichment. The color code of distinct nodes reflects their sources: orange bound
  nodes represent proteins extracted from LDA (statistically significant), green nodes
  represent DEPs and blue nodes represent proteins from LDA that are not DEPs.'
