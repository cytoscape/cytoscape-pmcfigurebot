caption: PPI network of identified DEGs affected by SA. The DEGs were imported to
  the STRING database to form an association network by automatic comparison (A).
  The PPI network was further analyzed using Cytoscape software, and a diagram of
  the interactive network is presented (B). A node represents a protein. The node
  size and color were determined by the degree of DEG interaction. The combined score
  represents the interaction between nodes. The edge size and color were determined
  by the combined score. The core gene is marked with the blue dashed circle.
