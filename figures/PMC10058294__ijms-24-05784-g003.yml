caption: Proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network of differentially expressed proteins
  in A549 cells with empty vectors and A549 cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2 N protein.
  Physical or/and functional interactions are highlighted by thicker edges and in
  consideration of experimental (STRING score > 0.15) and database (STRING score >
  0.35) annotated interactions. The networks were visualized by Cytoscape v.3.9.1
  software, while biological processes were retrieved by STRING enrichment. The color
  code of distinct nodes reflects the differential expression of a protein in the
  examined conditions (orange for up-regulated in A549 with empty vector and blue
  light for up-regulated in A549 with SARS-CoV-2 N protein).
